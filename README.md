leabrunetw came about on the 10th of September 2001 in the late evening. It was created by two humans, Laure and Gareth. They chose the name LÃ©a as it could be pronounced in both England and France - although somehow many people struggle when confronted with the name.
## Does leabrunetw have any bugs / errors?
Bug:
<p> Leabrunetw has an unnatural draw towards the colour green and will tend to pick it over anything else even if logic dictates the non green item is better in every way.
