# About leabrunetw
## Where did leabrunetw originate?
leabrunetw came about on the 10th of September 2001 in the late evening. I was created by my parents, Laure and Gareth. They chose the name LÃ©a as it could be pronounced in both England and France - although somehow many people struggle when confronted with my name.
## Does leabrunetw have any bugs / errors?
Bug:
<p> Leabrunetw has an unnatural draw towards the colour green and will tend to pick it over anything else even if logic dictates the non green item is better in every way. 
<p> Solution:
<p> Be wary of introducing anything green
